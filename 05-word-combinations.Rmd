# Relationships between words {#ngrams}

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)

```

So far we've considered words as individual units, and connected them to documents or sentiments to perform our analyses. However, many interesting text analyses are based on the relationships between words, whether examining words commonly used in proximity to each other or that tend to occur within the same documents.

In this chapter, we'll explore some of the tools that tidytext offers for determining relationships between words in your text dataset. This includes the `token = "ngrams"` argument, which tokenizes by pairs of adjacent words rather than by individual words. We'll also introduce two new packages: [ggraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph), which extends ggplot2 to construct network plots, nd [widyr](https://github.com/dgrtwo/widyr) package, which calculates pairwise correlations and distances within a tidy data frame.

## Tokenizing by n-gram

We've been using the `unnest_tokens` function to tokenize by word, or sometimes by sentence or paragraph, which is useful . But we can also use the function to tokenize into consecutive sequences of words, called **n-grams**. By seeing how often word X is followed by word Y, we can then build a model of the relationships between them.

We do this by adding the `token = "ngrams"` option to `unnest_tokens()`, and setting `n` to the number of words we wish to capture in each n-gram. When we set `n` to 2, we are examining pairs of two consecutive words, often called "bigrams":

```{r austen_bigrams}
library(dplyr)
library(tidytext)
library(janeaustenr)

austen_bigrams <- austen_books() %>%
  unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2)

austen_bigrams
```

This data structure is still a variation of the tidy text format. It is structured as one-row-per-token (with extra metadata, such as `book`, still preserved), but each token now represents a bigram. Notice that these bigrams overlap: "sense and" is one token, while "and sensibility" is another.

### Counting and filtering n-grams

Our usual tidy tools apply equally well to n-gram analysis. We can examine the most common bigrams using dplyr's `count()`:

```{r, dependson = "austen_bigrams"}
austen_bigrams %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE)
```

As one might expect, a lot of the most common bigrams are pairs of common (uninteresting) words, such as `of the` and `to be`: what we call "stop-words" (see Chapter \@ref{#tidytext}). This is a useful time to use tidyr's `separate()`, which splits a column into multiple based on a delimiter. This lets us separate it into two columns, "word1" and "word2", at which we can remove cases where either is a stop-word .

```{r dependson = "austen_bigrams"}
library(tidyr)

bigrams_separated <- austen_bigrams %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")

bigrams_filtered <- bigrams_separated %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)

# New bigram counts:
bigrams_filtered %>%
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)
```

We can see that names (whether first and last or with a salutation) are the most common pairs in Jane Austen books.

In other analyses, we may want to work with the recombined words. tidyr's `unite()` function is the inverse of `separate()`, and lets us recombine the columns into one.

```{r bigrams_united, dependson = "bigrams_filtered"}
bigrams_united <- bigrams_filtered %>%
  unite(bigram, word1, word2, sep = " ")

bigrams_united
```

We may also be interested in the most common tri-grams, sequences of 3 words. We can find this by setting `n = 3`:

```{r}
austen_books() %>%
  unnest_tokens(trigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 3) %>%
  separate(trigram, c("word1", "word2", "word3"), sep = " ") %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word,
         !word2 %in% stop_words$word,
         !word3 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  count(word1, word2, word3, sort = TRUE)
```

### Analyzing bigrams

This one-row-per-bigram format is helpful for exploratory analyses of the text. As a simple example, we might be interested in the most common "streets" mentioned in each book:

```{r}
bigrams_filtered %>%
  filter(word2 == "street") %>%
  count(book, word1, sort = TRUE)
```

A bigram can also be treated as a term in a document in the same way that we treated individual words. For example, we can look at the TF-IDF (Chapter \@ref{#tf_idf}) of bigrams across Austen novels.

```{r bigram_tf_idf, dependson = "bigram_counts"}
bigram_tf_idf <- bigrams_united %>%
  count(book, bigram) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(bigram, book, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))

bigram_tf_idf
```

These TF-IDF values can be visualized within each book, just as we did for words.

```{r bigram_tf_idf_plot, dependson = "bigram_tf_idf", echo = FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=9}
bigram_tf_idf %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  top_n(12, tf_idf) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(bigram = reorder(bigram, tf_idf)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(bigram, tf_idf, fill = book)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8, stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ book, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "TF-IDF of bigram to novel",
       x = "")
```

Much as we discovered in [Chapter 4](#tfidf), the units that distinguish each Austen book are almost exclusively names. We also notice some pairings of a common verb and a name, such as "replied elizabeth" in Pride & Prejudice, or "cried emma" in Emma.

There are advantages and disadvantages to examining the TF-IDF of bigrams rather than individual words. Pairs of consecutive words might capture structure that isn't present when one is just counting single words, and may provide context that makes tokens more understandable (for example, "pulteney street", in Northanger Abbey, is more informative than "pulteney"). However, the per-bigram counts are also *sparser*: a typical two-word pair is rarer than either of its component words. Thus, bigrams can be especially useful when you have a very large text dataset.

### Using bigrams to provide context in sentiment analysis

Our sentiment analysis approch in Chapter \ref{3](#sentiment) simply counted the appearance of positive or negative words, according to a reference lexicon. One of the problems with this approach is that a word's context can matter nearly as much as its presence. For example, the words "happy" and "like" will be counted as positive, even in a sentence like "I'm not **happy** and I don't **like** it!"

Now that we have the data organized into bigrams, it's easy to tell how often words are preceded by a word like "not":

```{r dependson = "bigrams_separated"}
bigrams_separated %>%
  filter(word1 == "not") %>%
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)
```

By performing sentiment analysis on the bigram data, we can examine how often sentiment-associated words are preceded by "not" or other negating words. We could use this to ignore or even reverse their contribution to the sentiment score.

Let's use the AFINN lexicon for sentiment analysis, which you may recall gives a numeric sentiment score for each word:

```{r AFINN_ngrams}
AFINN <- get_sentiments("afinn")

AFINN
```

We can then examine the most frequent words that were preceded by "not" and were associated with a sentiment.

```{r not_words, dependson = c("austen_bigrams", "AFINN_ngrams")}
not_words <- bigrams_separated %>%
  filter(word1 == "not") %>%
  inner_join(AFINN, by = c(word2 = "word")) %>%
  count(word2, score, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()

not_words
```

For example, the most common sentiment-associated word to follow "not" was "like", which would normally have a (positive) sentiment score of 2.

It's worth asking which words contributed the most in the "wrong" direction. To compute that, we can multiply their score by the number of times they appear (so that a word with a sentiment score of +3 occurring 10 times has as much impact as a word with a sentiment score of +1 occurring 30 times).

```{r not_words_plot, dependson = "not_words", fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
not_words %>%
  mutate(contribution = n * score) %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(contribution))) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  mutate(word2 = reorder(word2, contribution)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word2, n * score, fill = n * score > 0)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  xlab("Words preceded by \"not\"") +
  ylab("Sentiment score * number of occurrences") +
  coord_flip()
```

The bigrams "not like" and "not help" were overwhelmingly the largest causes of misidentification, making the text seem much more positive than it is. But we can see phrases like "not afraid" and "not fail" sometimes suggest text is more negative than it is.

"Not" isn't the only term that provides some context for the following word. We could pick four common words (or more) that negate the following, and use the same joining and counting approach to examine all of them at once.

```{r negated_words, dependson = "bigrams_separated"}
negation_words <- c("not", "no", "never", "without")

negated_words <- bigrams_separated %>%
  filter(word1 %in% negation_words) %>%
  inner_join(AFINN, by = c(word2 = "word")) %>%
  count(word1, word2, score, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()

negated_words
```

```{r negated_words_plot, dependson = "negated_words", fig.width=9, fig.height=9}
negated_words %>%
  mutate(contribution = n * score) %>%
  mutate(word2 = reorder(paste(word2, word1, sep = "__"), contribution)) %>%
  group_by(word1) %>%
  top_n(10, abs(contribution)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word2, contribution, fill = n * score > 0)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ word1, scales = "free") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) gsub("__.+$", "", x)) +
  xlab("Words preceded by negation term") +
  ylab("Sentiment score * # of occurrences") +
  coord_flip()
```

### Visualizing a network of bigrams with igraph

We may be interested in visualizing all of the relationships among words simultaneously, rather than just the top few at a time.

```{r bigram_counts, dependson = "bigrams_filtered"}
bigram_counts <- bigrams_filtered %>% 
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)

bigram_counts
```

As one powerful visualization, we can arrange the words into a network, or "graph." Here we'll be referring to a "graph" not in the sense of a visualization, but as a combination of connected nodes. A graph can be created from a tidy object because a graph has three variables:

* **from**: the node an edge is coming from
* **to**: the node an edge is going towards
* **weight** A numeric value associated with each edge

The [igraph](http://igraph.org/) package has many powerful functions for manipulating and analyzing networks. The most typical way to create an igraph object from tidy data is the `graph_from_data_frame()` function.

```{r bigram_graph, dependson = "bigram_counts"}
library(igraph)

# filter for only relatively common combinations
bigram_graph <- bigram_counts %>%
  filter(n > 20) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame()

bigram_graph
```

igraph has plotting functions built in, but they're not what the package is designed to do. Many others have developed visualization methods for graphs. We recommend the ggraph package, because it implements these visualizations in terms of the grammar of graphics, which we are already familiar with from ggplot2.

We can convert an igraph object into a ggraph with the `ggraph` function, after which we add layers to it, much like layers are added in ggplot2. For example, here we add nodes, edges, and text to construct the basics of a graph:

```{r bigram_ggraph_austen, dependson = "bigram_graph"}
library(ggraph)
set.seed(2016)

ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link() +
  geom_node_point() +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1)
```

We now see more details of the network structure. For example, we see that salutations such as "miss", "lady", "sir", "and "colonel" form common centers of nodes, which are often followed by names. We also see pairs or triplets along the outside that form common short phrases ("half hour," "ten minutes", "thousand pounds").

As a few polishing operations:

* We add the `edge_alpha` aesthetic to the link layer to make links transparent based on how common or rare the bigram is
* We add directionality with an arrow, constructed using `grid::arrow()`
* We tinker with the options to the node layer to make the nodes more attractive (larger, blue points)
* We add a theme that's useful for plotting networks, `theme_void()`

```{r bigram_ggraph_austen2, dependson = "bigram_graph"}
set.seed(2016)

a <- grid::arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(.15, "inches"))

ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n), show.legend = FALSE, arrow = a) +
  geom_node_point(color = "lightblue", size = 5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1) +
  theme_void()
```

It may take a some experimentation with ggraph to get your networks into a presentable format like this, but the network structure is useful and flexible way to visualize relational tidy data.

### Visualizing bigrams in other texts

We went to a good amount of work in cleaning and visualizing bigrams on a text dataset. So let's collect it into a function so that we can do it on other text datasets easily.

```{r}
count_bigrams <- function(dataset) {
  dataset %>%
    unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>%
    separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
    filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
    filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
    count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)
}

visualize_bigrams <- function(bigrams) {
  set.seed(2016)
  
  bigrams %>%
    graph_from_data_frame() %>%
    ggraph(layout = "fr") +
    geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n), show.legend = FALSE, arrow = a) +
    geom_node_point(color = "lightblue", size = 5) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1) +
    theme_void()
}
```

At this point, we could visualize bigrams in other works, such as the King James Version of the Bible:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# The King James version is book 10 on Project Gutenberg:
library(gutenbergr)
kjv <- gutenberg_download(10)
```

```{r kjv, echo = FALSE}
load("data/kjv.rda")
```

```{r kjv_bigrams, dependson = "kjv"}
library(stringr)

kjv_bigrams <- kjv %>%
  count_bigrams()

kjv_bigrams

# filter out rare combinations, as well as digits
set.seed(2016)

kjv_bigrams %>%
  filter(n > 40,
         !str_detect(word1, "\\d"),
         !str_detect(word2, "\\d")) %>%
  visualize_bigrams()
```

## Counting and correlating pairs of words with the widyr package

Tokenizing by n-gram is a useful way to explore pairs of adjacent words. However, we may also be interested in words that tend to co-occur within particular documents or particular chapters.

Tidy data is a useful structure for comparing between variables or grouping by rows, but it can be challenging to compare between rows: for example, to count the number of times that two words appear within the same document.

This is provided by the [widyr](https://github.com/dgrtwo/widyr) package, which focuses on encapsulating the pattern of "widen data, perform an operation, then re-tidy data."

![The philosophy behind the widyr package, which can operations such as counting and correlating on pairs of values in a tidy dataset.](images/widyr.jpg)

This makes certain operations for comparing words much easier. We'll focus on a set of functions that make pairwise comparisons between groups of observations (for example, between documents, or sections).

### Counting and correlating among sections

Consider the book "Pride and Prejudice" divided into 10-line sections, as we did for sentiment analysis in Chapter 3. We may be interested in what words tend to appear within the same section.

```{r austen_section_words}
austen_section_words <- austen_books() %>%
  filter(book == "Pride & Prejudice") %>%
  mutate(section = row_number() %/% 10) %>%
  filter(section > 0) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word)

austen_section_words
```

One example of the widyr pattern is the `pairwise_count` function. The prefix "pairwise" means it will result in one row for each pair of words in the `word` variable. This lets us count common pairs of words co-appearing within the same section:

```{r count_pairs_words, dependson = "austen_section_words"}
library(widyr)

# count words co-occuring within sections
word_pairs <- austen_section_words %>%
  pairwise_count(word, section, sort = TRUE)

word_pairs
```

For example, we discover that the most common pair of words in a section is "Elizabeth" and "Darcy" (the two main characters).

```{r}
word_pairs %>%
  filter(item1 == "darcy")
```

### Pairwise correlation

Pairs like "Elizabeth" and "Darcy" are the most common co-occurring words, but that's not particularly meaningful since **they're also the most common words.** We instead want to examine *correlation* among words, which is how often they appear together relative to how often they appear separately.

TODO: formula for Pearson correlation, explanation of phi coefficient

The `pairwise_cor()` function in widyr lets us perform a Pearson correlation between words based on how often they appear in the same section.

```{r}
library(widyr)

# We need to filter for at least relatively common words first
word_cors <- austen_section_words %>%
  group_by(word) %>%
  filter(n() >= 20) %>%
  pairwise_cor(word, section, sort = TRUE)

word_cors
```

For instance, we could find the words most correlated with a word like "pounds" by filtering:

```{r}
word_cors %>%
  filter(item1 == "pounds")
```

This would let us examine the most-correlated words with any selection of words:

```{r dependson = "word_cors", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8}
word_cors %>%
  filter(item1 %in% c("elizabeth", "pounds", "married", "pride")) %>%
  group_by(item1) %>%
  top_n(6) %>%
  mutate(item2 = reorder(item2, correlation)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(item2, correlation)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ item1, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()
```

Just as we used ggraph to visualize bigrams, we can use it to visualize the correlations and clusters of words that were found by the widyr package.

```{r word_cors_network, dependson = "word_cors"}
set.seed(2016)

word_cors %>%
  filter(correlation > .15) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame() %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = correlation), show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_node_point(color = "lightblue", size = 5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE) +
  theme_void()
```

Note that unlike the bigram analysis, the relationships here are symmetric, rather than directional. We can also see that while pairings of names and titles that dominated bigram pairings are common, such as "colonel/fitzwilliam", we can also see pairings of words that appear close to each other, such as "walk" and "park".

These network visualizations are a flexible tool for exploring relationships, and will play an important role in the case studies in later chapters.
